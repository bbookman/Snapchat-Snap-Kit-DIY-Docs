## Purpose
Snapchat’s Snap Kit is new and there are holes in the documentation. As developers implement Snap Kit, they will find answers and gain best practices.  This document exists to help developers obtain success with Snap Kit.

### Copying Snap Kit Documentation
The [wiki for this repository](https://github.com/bbookman/Snapchat-Snap-Kit-DIY-Docs/wiki) will contain copy/paste from [Snapkit documentation](https://docs.snapchat.com/docs/). The purpose of which is to make it easy to see what is there as well as what should be there.  Contributsions from sources other than the Snap Kit documentation will be noted as such.

For text that did not orignate from Snapchat, two markers are inserted:
* DIY INSERT START
* DIY INSERT END

## DIY Knowledge Base
If any dev out there runs into a problem and solution, I'd like to add it to the brand new (as of 9/2018) Knowlege Base
