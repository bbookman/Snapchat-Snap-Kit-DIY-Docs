### Purpose
Snapchat’s Snapkit is new and there are holes in the documentation. As developers implement Snapkit, they will develop best practices. This document exists to help developers obtain success with Snapkit and document the best practices they come across.

There will be copy/paste form the [Snapkit documentation](https://docs.snapchat.com/docs/). The purpose of which is to make it easy to see what is there as well as what should be there
